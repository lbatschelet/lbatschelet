## About Me

I'm a geographer and student assistant at the Institute of Geography at the University of Bern. After working as a secondary school teacher, I moved into geography and its digital methods and now combine social and cultural geography with design and technology in my work.

I build open, participatory tools and visual formats to explore and communicate situated and subjective experiences in space, with a particular focus on wellbeing, accessibility, and clear knowledge transfer.

Many of my repositories are lecture notes, summaries, and small learning projects, alongside research prototypes and other experimental tools.
